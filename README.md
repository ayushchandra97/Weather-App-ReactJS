# Weather-App-ReactJS

This weather app is made using React.js using vite, vanilla CSS and react-error-boundary.

It uses Geonames API to fetch places names in search bar and Openweather API to display weather information on the searched place.

Currently only shows current temperature, wind speed and humidity.

It also uses react-error-boundary to handle errors and show a fallback UI.

More Features I'm working on are incorporating max and min temperatures, 3 hour 5 days forecast, and improving the UI.
